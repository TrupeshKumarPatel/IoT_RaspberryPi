		Asterisk PBX~\cite{sangoma-technologies} is a software implementation of Private Branch Exchange (PBX), a system used to handle telecommunication services, allowing VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) services on computers, including less powerful devices such as Raspberry Pi. However, using smaller single-board devices come with the limitation of computing power and storage capacity. As a result of these limitations are dropping packets, cutting off the callers while handling a more significant number of calls simultaneously. In this project, the authors provides the proof-of-concept by analyining the packets delays, network jitters, end-to-end network latency, and bandwidth between an Asterisk PBX system (which is install on Raspberry Pi 4~\cite{cytron-technologies}) and IP clients that are using VoIP as service. This analyis includes internet through wired, wireless, cellular wireless connection. 
%		In this project, the authors propose running a distributed Raspberry Pi model over an ad-hoc network with an Asterisk PBX system to determine how well VoIP services work within a distributed single-board system. Then this network configuration will be tested for the maximum number of calls, packets delays, network jitters, end-to-end network latency, and bandwidth as work shared between multiple Raspberry Pi.
